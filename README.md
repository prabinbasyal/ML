# Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of hands-on machine learning projects I‚Äôve worked on as part of my learning journey. Each folder contains code, notebooks, and models focused on a specific ML concept ‚Äî from simple regressions to more advanced classification algorithms.

## üîç What‚Äôs Inside

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the topics covered:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Multilinear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Ridge, Lasso & ElasticNet Regression**
- **Model Evaluation Scripts**
- **Mini Flask App for Deployment**
- **Lifecycle-based ML Project**  

Each folder includes code, comments, and some sample data to help understand the algorithm in practice.

# Special Thanks
A huge thank you to Krish Naik sir for his amazing Udemy course on Machine Learning.
His clear explanations and practical teaching style made it much easier for me to understand these concepts and apply them through real code. This repository is the result of learning from that course and practicing each module.
